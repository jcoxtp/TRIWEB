<h2>Fearfully and Wonderfully Made</h2>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>David expresses his awe of the intimate connection with his creator God in Psalm 
	139: &quot;For thou didst form my inward parts; thou doest weave me in my mother's 
	womb.&quot;</p>

<p style='font-size:8pt'>God told Jeremiah that He, Jehovah God, formed him in his mother's womb 
	(Jeremiah 1:5). In Isaiah 44:2 God reminds the people of Israel that He made 
	and formed each one of them in their mother's womb. In the New Testament, Paul 
	acknowledges this same truth when he explains that he was set apart by God in 
	his mother's womb (Galatians 1:15). The Creator God of the universe invests the 
	same care and attention in creating each of us as He did the world on which we 
	live.</p>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>Our God is a personal God who knows our names, numbers the very hairs on our 
	heads. And He is intimately acquainted with our ways. Although many factors 
	influence and shape one's personality, temperament, and social style, the 
	foundations of our temperament were crafted on God's workbench.
</p>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>The Personal DISCernment Inventory® will enable you to discover and define how 
	you view yourself and how you want others to see you. Through that process, 
	you'll learn more about the real you&#151;a person who might be slightly different 
	than you thought. It will give you new insight into how God made you.</p>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>Sometimes when people are first exposed to the idea of temperament or 
	personality, they may conclude that when they became a Christian, God changed 
	their personality. When asked about the rationale for this conclusion, someone 
	often says, &quot;I'm different than I was before. I think differently and I act 
	differently.&quot; If our observations from scripture are accurate, it is unlikely 
	that God changed our personality since He created it. A more plausible 
	explanation would be that God's Spirit has irradiated our personality and begun 
	the work of transformation through the renewing of our mind (Romans 12:2).</p>
<h2>Increasing Personal Effectiveness</h2>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>Each of us has strengths and weaknesses that make us more effective in some 
	situations and less effective in others. In fact, leadership potential and 
	personal effectiveness are frequently determined by matching strengths against 
	particular situations. The more closely we are able to align our skills and 
	strengths with the situation, the higher the potential performance.</p>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>The ability to predict how we and other people will react and relate in certain 
	situations is of immeasurable value as we attempt to work with, serve, 
	influence, and communicate with others.</p>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>Behavior is influenced by a number of complex factors that include basic 
	personality or temperament, current emotional and physical state, our skills, 
	experiences, values, IQ, and motivational needs. These and many other factors 
	play both direct and indirect roles in shaping behavior.</p>
<p style='font-size:8pt'>Many of us have discovered that the more we know about ourselves and others, the 
	better we can anticipate behavior and, therefore, the better we can serve and 
	relate to other people. The Personal DISCernment Inventory® helps us understand 
	how and why people (including ourselves) are likely to behave in one way or 
	another. This insight is critical to increased personal effectiveness.</p>
