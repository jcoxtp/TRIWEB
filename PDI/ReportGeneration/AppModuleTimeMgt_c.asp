		The High C thrives on order, tradition, and conflict-free atmospheres with ample 
		opportunity for planning and 
		no sudden changes.

		High C methods are predetermined, precise, and attentive to details. Although High C's 
		are good at creating 
		organization, they tend to be less effective at managing themselves, often bogging 
		down in self-analysis and becoming overwhelmed about areas where they don't 
		measure up.
		C's have low to moderate energy levels that dissipate as they get buried in details.

		Attitudes toward time
		<%=EndAppModTitleFont%>
		<br><br>
		High C individuals always need more time to do things right, or they simply don't have 
		enough time to get everything done. They are usually on time because they don't want 
		to create an unfavorable situation for themselves by being late. They expect  others to 
		be on time also and are intolerant of others' tardiness.
