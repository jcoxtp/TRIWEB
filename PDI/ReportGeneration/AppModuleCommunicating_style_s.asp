		<%= strTextHighSCommunicatorsAreEasilyRec %><!--High S Communicators are
		easily recognized by their steady, fairly low-key delivery and less forceful
		tone and inflection. Often, the High S will speak more slowly and quietly,
		although many High S&#146;s can be animated and jovial. They tend to ask more than
		tell and reserve expressing their opinions openly. Their body language is often
		deliberate and controlled, with few gestures, and their delivery, for example
		in a formal presentation, can appear laid back and subdued. They are at their
		best communicating one-on-one or with a small, familiar group.-->

<%= strTextHighS146sAreNaturalListenersBe %><!--High S&#146;s are natural
listeners. Because they are interested in absorbing and digesting information
before responding, they give the speaker time to present his or her ideas&#151; while
at the same time appearing interested and concerned. Sincerity is a hallmark of
High S communication, and they take time to build relationships.-->

<%= strTextHoweverWhenCommunicatingWithTh %><!--However, when communicating
with the naturally enthusiastic High I or even High D, the High S may come across
as apathetic and slow to respond. High S&#146;s tend to express themselves rather
tentatively, both in face-to-face and on the telephone. They generally want to
confer with others before making a decision and are great consensus builders.-->

<%= strTextHighS146sLikeToDeliverStepbyst %><!--High S&#146;s like to deliver
step-by-step descriptions of incidents, and when they 
are receiving information,
they prefer that you present it to them in sequence. Their 
written communication is
well organized, with a logical progression of ideas.-->
