	<b>High I's</b> are charming, outgoing, and comfortable in both group or 
	one-on-one situations.&nbsp; They are comfortable meeting new people and put 
	potential clients at ease as well, establishing rapport quickly and 
	effectively.&nbsp; High I's are often effective motivators and are good at 
	getting agreement from clients, who generally buy into both the product or 
	service and the person of the advisor.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	High I's love to talk, and their speech tends to be informal and filled with 
	digressions.&nbsp; They pepper their conversation with stories and anecdotes 
	and tend to insert themselves into most experiences.&nbsp; "Well, you think 
	that was bad!&nbsp; Let me tell you what happened to me!"&nbsp; I's like to be 
	center stage, but they are also keenly interested in their clients and their 
	clients' families.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Their contagious enthusiasm and ability to communicate a positive vision foster 
	client confidence.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	However, they often talk more than they ask questions and may not listen as 
	well as they should.&nbsp; In some cases, they may substitute charm and 
	charisma for accuracy and make overly optimistic predictions.&nbsp; For those 
	clients with more low-key, reflective demeanors, the High I may appear 
	superficial.
</p>
<p>
	Once they establish a relationship, they are approachable and easy to 
	contact.&nbsp; However, they may have to get back to the client because they 
	can't always access the necessary information readily.
