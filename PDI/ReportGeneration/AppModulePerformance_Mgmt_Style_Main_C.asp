		<h1>Performance Management Styles</h1>
		
		<p><%=username1 %>, your DISC assessment indicates your are a High C.
		High C managers tend to be objective, fact-based, and task-oriented. Formal 
		and polite, High C’s will make sure that every step of the performance 
		management cycle takes place, on schedule. Goals will be highly detailed, and 
		High C managers are often more interested in quality than quantity they prefer 
		lower output to inferior results.</p>
		
		<div style="float:right"><img SRC="images/EN/HighC.gif"></div>
		
		<p>High C’s are careful to let people how what is expected, but they are equally 
		committed to providing the how, as well—with information, guidelines, and procedures. </p>
		
		<p>Because they are so committed to accuracy and thoroughness, they may at times 
		appear not to trust those who work for them, often questioning and second 
		guessing performance. In review sessions, they may focus too much on negatives 
		without giving the positive reinforcement that energizes and motivates.</p>
		
		<p>High C’s set a good example through their commitment to excellence, and they 
		are capable of presenting a logical, carefully thought-out presentation of how 
		people’s work contributes to worthwhile ends. They will be diligent about 
		putting things in writing so that employees are clear about goals and 
		expectations, and they will make sure that employees have the necessary training 
		to do their jobs.</p>
		
		<p>High C’s may frustrate the highly creative and innovative employees who want 
		to try new approaches to doing their jobs. They may also be non-demonstrative an 
		unenthusiastic about employees’ accomplishments and development; although they 
		will deliver positive feedback, they will spend much more time and be more 
		engaged when dealing with areas for improvement. </p>
		
		<p>Although C’s may be critical with interacting one-on-one with their direct 
		reports, they tend to be extremely loyal and supportive of them within the 
		larger organization.</p>
		
		<p>Generally, C’s are tough on themselves, and tough on others.</p>
