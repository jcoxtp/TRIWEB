		<h1>Performance Management Styles</h1>
		
		<p><%=username1 %>, your DISC assessment indicates your are a High S.
		High S managers are usually calm, friendly, and low key. The most hands-on 
		of all the styles, they will take their direct reports’ performance to heart, 
		maintaining personal commitment to each one’s success. Because they lead by 
		example and are dedicated to having everyone take part in decision making, 
		they will make certain that employees have ample input into planning and 
		goal-setting phase of managing their performance. And, since they allow others 
		to draw their own conclusions, interim coaching will be focused on letting the 
		employee elaborate on progress and pitfalls. </p>

		<p>Because they maintain a consistent “open-door” policy, employees will feel 
		comfortable volunteering information and discussing problems. The S’s 
		understanding nature, however, may leave employees with a false sense of 
		security about issues that need improvement, and the checkpoints that become 
		feel good sessions may not end with a clear plan for improving or correcting 
		performance. Further, because S’s are so adept at establishing strong personal 
		relationships, they may focus more on the employees’ personal goals and less on 
		tying goals to business results.</p>
		
		<p>Communicating praise and appreciation for a job well done will be easy for a 
		High S manager. Delivering unwelcome information about performance issues will 
		not. Because relationships are so important to the High S, and because High S 
		managers tend to be aware of many employees’ personal issues, they will have 
		difficulty making demands on employees’ whose performance is substandard, 
		particularly if they are knowledgeable about external factors, such as problems 
		at home.</p>
		
		<p>Because High S’s are natural listeners, employees will generally feel 
		comfortable in responding to feedback in the development review session. In 
		fact, S managers may be intimidated by employees who react aggressively to the 
		content of the review and may tend to back off of initial assertions regarding 
		performance. </p>
		
		<p>Because S’s, themselves dislike operating in an environment fraught with 
		tight deadlines and numerous crises, they may not instill a necessary sense of 
		urgency in the employee. They will also have to resist the urge to jump in and 
		“fix” some of the issues that the employee is having with his or her performance.</p>
		
		<p>Generally, S’s are tough on themselves and easy on others.</p>
