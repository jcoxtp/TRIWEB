	<b>High S </b>advisors prefer to deal with established clients in a friendly, 
	relaxed environment.&nbsp; Born "counselors," High S's are excellent listeners 
	and are consistently service oriented.&nbsp; Caring and sincere, the High S 
	genuinely wants to enhance the client's financial position.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
	Often, the High S will speak rather calmly and quietly, although many High S's 
	can be animated and jovial.&nbsp; They tend to ask more than tell and reserve 
	expressing their opinions openly.&nbsp; They tend to adopt a team approach, 
	acting more as an advocate and ally and less as a sales person.
</p>
<p>
	High S's give clients time to digest ideas and will rarely push for a 
	decision.&nbsp; They take time to build relationships first, and their approach 
	is low-key and non-threatening to even the most reticent client.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The High S calm demeanor and measured pace may communicate a lack of urgency to 
	some clients.&nbsp; In reality, the High S may simply feel the need to take 
	things slowly and give the client time to be sure.
</p>
<p>
	They present the plan in a logical, methodical matter, encouraging feedback and 
	questions from the client.&nbsp; Once the relationship is established, the High 
	S is diligent in follow up, with organized, thorough updates.
