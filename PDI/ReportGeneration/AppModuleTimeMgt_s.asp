		The High S is most comfortable in a relaxed, low-pressure, friendly atmosphere&#151;one 
		that offers security, limited territory, predictable routine, and credit for work 
		accomplished. High S personalities feel inadequate to the task of managing themselves, 
		so they usually avoid it. They need to see one step at a time, rather than the entire 
		process. Generally low-energy individuals, they need constant, strong affirmation to get 
		things done and like to work steadily and patiently.

		Attitudes toward time

		<br><br>
		High S's see time as a friend when they're not under pressure, but as an enemy when 
		they are operating under imposed deadlines. 
		<br><br>
		High S people may arrive either early or late, depending on what they have to do, but 
		they are generally on time when they are in charge. They forgive others' tardiness.
