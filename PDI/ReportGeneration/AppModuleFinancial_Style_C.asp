	<b>High C's </b>are objective, fact-based, and task-oriented.&nbsp; Formal and 
	polite, High C's rarely inject emotion, personal opinions, or gut feelings into 
	their discussions.&nbsp; They tend to ask questions more than make statements, 
	but at other times they can overwhelm a client with facts and details, 
	assigning the same degree of importance to so much information that it is 
	sometimes difficult to grasp the main points.
		
</p>
<p>
	Cautious and attentive to details, the High C advisor relies on charts, graphs, 
	and written material.&nbsp; In face-to-face meetings, their statements often 
	contain qualifiers and disclaimers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Unless they have come to know a client well, small talk is not on their radar 
	screen, and even then they respond more than they initiate.&nbsp; They may even 
	appear uninterested in the personal lives of their clients except where it 
	impacts the financial plan, and they are often very private about their 
	own.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	In lieu of a personal relationship, High C's establish their credibility 
	through their self-discipline, dedication, accuracy, and technical 
	expertise.&nbsp; Their thoughtful, orderly approach can convince clients of 
	their competence and reliability.
</p>
<p>
	They are diligent in their follow up, generally in the form of written 
	communication.&nbsp; If problems occur, they may appear vague or 
	ambiguous.&nbsp; In reality, their evasiveness is a smoke screen as their minds 
	race to review events and retrieve information to prove themselves right.
