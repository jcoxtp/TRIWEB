		<h1>Performance Management Styles</h1>
		
		<p><%=username1 %>, your DISC assessment indicates your are a High I.
		High I’s naturally gravitate to the people side of the business, so working 
		with employees and their development comes naturally to the gregarious High I. 
		Optimistic and enthusiastic, they are effective motivators and usually approachable 
		and non-threatening. They are often skilled at eliciting high performance from their 
		employees with their natural charm and the ease with which they interact with others.</p>
		
		<div style="float:right"><img SRC="images/EN/HighI.gif"></div>
		
		<p>Their natural approach tends to be casual and, at times, disorganized. For that 
		reason, they may tend to be vague about goals and negligent in making sure that they 
		are written down and mutually agreed-upon. They may have difficulty staying focused 
		during coaching sessions, since they tend to insert themselves into most experiences. 
		“Well, you think you’re having difficulty learning that process! Let me tell you what 
		happened to me!” I’s like to be center stage and may even feel slightly threatened by 
		high-performing employees.</p>
		
		<p>In evaluation employees, the High I’s tendency to react to impressions or perceptions 
		rather than facts may be a stumbling block to providing thorough feedback. On the other 
		hand, they are particularly adapt at establishing rapport with employees and instilling 
		confidence. Because they are skilled at communicating a compelling vision, they can usually 
		demonstrate how an individual’s activities impact business results.</p>
		
		<p>High I’s generally encourage others to be open and will usually communicate big picture 
		goals. Their upbeat “we can do it” style makes people feel like winners—so much so that 
		employees may not have a specific description of their areas for improvement. Because I’s 
		have difficulty separating people from issues, and because they want to create and maintain 
		a pleasant environment, they may not be as clear in delivering unwelcome information as the 
		situation demands.</p>
		
		<p>They may talk too much during the session and have trouble listening carefully to the 
		employee’s responses.</p>
		
		<p>In general, High I’s are easy on themselves and easy on others.</p>
