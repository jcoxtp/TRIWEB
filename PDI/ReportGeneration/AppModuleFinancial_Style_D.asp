	<b>High D's </b>are self starters who thrive on challenges.&nbsp; They are 
	completely comfortable calling on potential clients whom they have never 
	met.&nbsp; They generally come on strong and quickly take charge of the 
	meeting.&nbsp; They tend to talk more than they listen, and tell more than they 
	ask.&nbsp; They want to present their plan in a strong, direct manner and often 
	expect both potential and existing clients to make a quick decision

</p><BR>
<p>
	High D advisor strengths lie in their ability to stay focused on goals, and 
	their positive, concise, clear presentation of the plan.&nbsp; These attributes 
	engender confidence in clients—particularly in those clients with a similar 
	style.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, High D's tend to spend little time in communicating to build 
	relationships. &nbsp;They have limited interest in small talk, either on the 
	telephone or in person, and aren't concerned with personal topics unless they 
	figure into their overall objectives.&nbsp; They push for agreement early and 
	often and may become impatient if results don't come quickly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	At times, they may intimidate less assertive clients who occasionally feel 
	overwhelmed, but, at the same time, they aren't put off by resistance or 
	difficult clients.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	They tend to present the high points of a plan and expect the client to dig 
	into the details for him/herself and ask questions if necessary.
