	<h4>High D</h4>

<UL>
	<LI>
		Try to be more assertive and confident in your meeting.&nbsp; Stand your 
		ground, and offer your expert opinions.&nbsp; Don't be intimidated by the 
		strong-willed, challenging D.

	<LI>
		Spend more time focusing on results than process.

	<h4>High I</h4>

<UL>
	<LI>
		You may be uncomfortable with the overly friendly I, particularly if he/she 
		seems to be wasting time. &nbsp;You will, however, appreciate the I's interest 
		in you as a person.&nbsp; Try to be more responsive to the I's enthusiasm and 
		animation, so that he/she doesn't perceive you as uninterested or blasé.&nbsp; 
		Recognize the High I's tendency to wander, so take responsibility for 
		controlling the meeting's direction.

	<h4>High S</h4>

<UL>
	<LI>
		Provide assurances, and stress benefits.&nbsp; Don't take it personally if the 
		S client appears reluctant to share some personal information. &nbsp;Explain 
		the reasons for your questions.&nbsp; Don't forget to move to closure when 
		appropriate. &nbsp;You may need to create a bit of a sense of urgency for the 
		reticent S.
	</LI>
</UL>

	<h4>High C</h4>

<UL>
	<LI>
		Don't be intimidated by the C's challenges and skepticism. Your style of not 
		moving too quickly will appeal to the C, but you may need to take the lead in 
		moving the C to a decision.
