		D's shape the environment by overcoming opposition to accomplish results. Self 
		starters, D's thrive on competition and are usually direct, positive, and straightforward&#151;
		sometimes blunt. They like to be center stage and in control.
		<br><br>
		High D's respond positively to tough assignments and heavy work loads. They demand 
		a great deal of themselves and others. Their energy level is high, and they can exercise 
		strong willpower when it helps them reach their goals.

		Attitudes toward time
		<%=EndAppModTitleFont%><br><br>
		
		D's attack time to conquer it, making the most of every minute.  They usually arrive at 
		appointments on time, but reserve the right to be late if something more important 
		comes up. However, D's don't like to wait for others, so they expect everyone else to be 
		on time and then wait for them if necessary.
