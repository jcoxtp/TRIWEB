		<h1>Performance Management Styles</h1>
		
		<p><%=username1 %>, your DISC assessment indicates your are a High D. 
		High D’s focus more on the destination than the journey. They have little 
		patience with activities that lack clear, measurable goals. Thus, they will 
		be actively involved in the goal-setting phase of performance management. 
		High D’s have an affinity for relating goals to business results—connecting 
		people and plans.</p>
		
		<div style="float:right"><img SRC="images/EN/HighD.gif"></div>
		
		<p>Since they talk more than they listen, and tell more than they ask, they 
		may have a tendency to set the goals for employees rather than take the time 
		to engage in a give and take dialogue to establish a shared direction.</p>

		<p>D’s demand a fair amount of independent decision-making, and they will 
		expect employees to take considerable initiative in managing their own 
		performance. Coaching sessions may be brief with a no-nonsense approach 
		to performance problems and little emphasis on what is going well. High 
		D’s tend to spend little time in communicating to build relationships. 
		They have minimal interest in small talk and aren’t particularly concerned 
		about discussing personal topics unless they choose to initiate them. Since 
		they thrive on a crisis environment, they may wait until they see something 
		going wrong before scheduling a checkpoint session. </p>

		<p>In coaching situations, they tend to dominate conversations. Generally poor 
		listeners, when they do listen, they do it selectively. Employees need to be 
		aggressive in making their points, or the information may be lost. On the other 
		hand, High D’s tend to be champions of the people who report to them. They will 
		make sure that employees have the resources they need to do their jobs. </p>

		<p>Generally, D’s will be fair and objective in evaluating performance, and they 
		will be clear in communicating the results. Their remarks, however, may tend to 
		be more high-level and general, and they may struggle with providing specific examples. </p>

		<p>Further, they may not be particularly forthcoming with praise and positive 
		reinforcement—except in a perfunctory way. They will usually provide information 
		on opportunities for development in a matter of fact manner that focuses on the 
		issue rather than the person. </p>

		<p>As with initial goal setting, High D’s will be diligent in helping employees 
		set development goals.</p>

		<p>In general, D’s are easy on themselves and tough on others.</p>
