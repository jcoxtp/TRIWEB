                    <p>Your Personal <strong>DISC</strong>ernment<sup>&reg;</sup> Inventory report will show you which of the four major personality types best represents you: D, I, S or C. But that's only the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Your report will clarify how to identify and relate to each of the four types. Keep reading to learn more.</p>

                    <h2 id="sec1">Your Observable Traits</h2>
                    <p>Your report will provide a list of the observable traits others most often see when interacting with you.</p>

                    <h2 id="sec2">The 28 Representative Patterns</h2>
                    <p>To some degree, every personality contains all four styles, even though some elements are high and others low. The particular ways in which the four factors combine and influence one another form 28  "representative" behavioral styles. This style reflects most clearly how others see you.</p>
                    <p>Each Representative Pattern identifies the following aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Observable Traits</li>
                        <li>Internal Motivators</li>
                        <li>Potential for Growth</li>
                        <li>Ideal Work Setting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your report will teach you which of the 28 Representative Patterns best fits you, and provide details on the other 27 to help you better understand them.</p>

                    <p>Your report won't just tell you the basics of your personality. It provides three graphs showing you your Projected, Private, and Public Concepts &mdash; allowing you to see your personality from three different personal perspectives.</p>
                    <strong>The Projected Concept</strong>
                    <p>The Projected Concept reflects how you think others want you to behave or how you want them to see you. This is the <q>mask</q> people assume in order to achieve success.</p>
                    <strong>The Private Concept</strong>
                    <p>This is your natural behavior—what you are deep down. This behavior is a product of heredity and early environment.</p>
                    <strong>The Public Concept</strong>
                    <p>The third graph represents the net effect of the Private and Projected Concepts and reflects most clearly how others really see you.</p>
