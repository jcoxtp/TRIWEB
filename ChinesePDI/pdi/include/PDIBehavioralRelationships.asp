strDOVERI = "You tend to be direct and straightforward. You prefer to ‘level’ with people and tell it like it is. You are intellectually curious and are stimulated by difficult problems requiring brainpower and logical results/analysis. You are not particularly interested in pleasing people and at times can be blunt, sarcastic, and critical."

strDOVERS = "You are impatient for quick results and can have an instinctive drive for power. You react quickly, are easily bored and respond well to challenge. You are versatile, flexible, self-motivated, urgent, and sometimes irritable. You can withstand pressure and exert pressure on others. Critical and dissatisfied, you are comfortable with shifting goals, new projects, and innovative methods."

strDOVERC = "You thrive on opposition; you will take a strong stand and fight for it. You are determined to do things your way. Frank, honest, and direct, you can take over, act positively, and move without consultation. You are usually well respected when things are going well, and you are right most of the time. When a shortfall occurs, someone will usually identify your rashness as the reason."

strIOVERD = "You desire to be accepted and, to that end, are friendly, optimistic, trusting, and poised. You are cordial and charming, gregarious and talkative. You are at your best in a favorable social environment."

strIOVERS = "You can be impulsive and feel the need to attract attention. You reach out to people and initiate contact with them easily and smoothly. Your contagious optimism, instant enthusiasm, and spontaneous persuasiveness are geared to win people over, and you often succeed."

strIOVERC = "You are very sure of yourself. You need, and usually have, supreme confidence in your own ability. You prefer to act with others to get what you want. You can be stubborn in a friendly way, dominate a social situation, and smile while arguing the point. You display an effusive independence, and if people reject you or your ideas, you may reject them in return."

strSOVERD = "Your desire for simplicity and your aversion to open aggressiveness combine to make you self-controlled, steady, and consistent. Modest, easy-going, and deliberate, you like to do one thing at a time and you resist changes that upset the status quo. You can quietly slow things down when frustrated and may bear a grudge."

strSOVERI = "You desire quiet, peaceful surroundings where you can proceed at your own pace. You much prefer working with things to influencing others. You are patient, controlled, moderate, and deliberate. Sometimes shy, you are not a natural conversationalist and you dislike antagonism and conflicts."

strSOVERC = "Your disposition is to be both deliberate and stubborn. You prefer to set your own pace and stick with it. You are a ‘task completer’ and resent being pushed. Once you have made up your mind, you are difficult to change. You are plodding and persistent with an apparent long fuse. You can, however, be willful, balky, and difficult to persuade."

strCOVERD = "You are cautious and prefer cooperation to trouble. You are conservative, precise, and diplomatic. You are often a stickler for details, an enforcer of rules, and a questioner of anything different. You are devoted to avoiding trouble, especially the kind that could be prevented by just a little more checking. Your consistent performance and thorough approach give the impression that you have great insight."

strCOVERI = "Reserved and reflective, you are devoted to precedent, institutions, exact standards, systems, defined procedures, and traditional methods. You want to avoid unnecessary risk and trouble. You are conventional, usually diplomatic and cooperative, and often apprehensive."

strCOVERS = "You tend to be diplomatic and precise on one hand and restless and discontented on the other. This combination often results in tension, nervousness, and general uneasiness. You are unhappy until the correctness of your action or decision has been confirmed. You are sensitive, sometimes shrewd, and very alert. You usually do not miss ulterior motives or deceptive practices on the part of others."

strDEQUALC = "You want to achieve, but you also want to be right. You are frequently dissatisfied in your search for the best possible answer. You appear to vacillate and to be indecisive. Since you have an equal striving for accomplishment and quality, you are often an unrealistic perfectionist. You can become terse and unpredictable, confusing your associates. You struggle between creativity and perfectionism on one hand and vacillation and indecision on the other."
