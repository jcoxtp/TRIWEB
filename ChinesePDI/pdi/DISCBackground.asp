	<p>Dr. William M. Marston, a Columbia University psychologist in the early 20th century, developed the theory of human behavior on which the <!--#INCLUDE FILE="include/pdi.asp" --> is based. Through his extensive research, he identified four major behavioral patterns that are present in all people, but to varying degrees.</p>

	<p> Marston's theory contends that these four patterns emerge as a result of various combinations of certain key factors. Most people tend to be either <em>task-oriented</em> or <em>people-oriented</em>. Another way to describe people is by their response to the environment. Some people are <em>assertive</em> or <em>active</em>; they want to shape or change their environment to better suit themselves. Others are more <em>responsive</em>; they tend to accept things as they are and try to do the best job possible within their environment. Using these four factors: task vs. people, assertive vs. responsive, we can place people into one of four quadrants.</p>						

	<p>Over the years, many other researchers have built on this four-dimensional model of personality, making it one of the most popular systems for teaching people about behavioral styles. Our collection of reports is called the <!--#INCLUDE FILE="include/disc.asp" -->, and it is based on the following factors:</p>
