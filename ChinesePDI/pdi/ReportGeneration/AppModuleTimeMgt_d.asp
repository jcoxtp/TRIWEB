		High D's respond positively to tough assignments and heavy work loads. They demand

		D's attack time to conquer it, making the most of every minute.  They usually arrive at 
		appointments on time, but reserve the right to be late if something more important 
		comes up. However, D's don't like to wait for others, so they expect everyone else to be 
		on time and then wait for them if necessary.
