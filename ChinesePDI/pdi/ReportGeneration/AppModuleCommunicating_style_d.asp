might describe the high <%=HighType1%> communicator as follows:

		<b>High D&#146;s</b> communicate
		readily&#151;on their terms. They talk more than they listen, and tell more than
		they ask. They can be dynamic speakers, table bangers, or steely silent types.
		They may speak quickly and at high volume, or they may issue terse comments
		that force you to listen carefully. They tend to make strong (often
		gate-closing, no-comment-required) statements that are to the point and often
		blunt. Their body language is decisive and energetic, with little wasted
		motion.</span>

High D&#146;s tend to spend
little time in communicating to build relationships. They have little interest
in small talk, either on the telephone or in person, and aren&#146;t concerned about
discussing personal topics unless they choose to initiate them.
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
Often commanding speakers,
they tend to dominate conversations. Generally poor listeners, when they do
listen, they do it selectively. However, good friends are the exception to this
premise. When in the presence of close associates, a High D can be interested,
engaged, and a good listener.
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
D&#146;s expect you to be prepared and concise when
you deliver a message to them. If you take too long to say something that
interests them, they will let you know quickly, either verbally or nonverbally.
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
When you are in a meeting with a High D in his
or her office, expect to be interrupted frequently by phone calls, coworkers,
and other distractions. High D&#146;s multi-task with ease, and they don&#146;t see it as
a problem if you have to wait for them to handle other issues. 
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
Although they would rather
speak, when writing they get directly to the point. Notes are almost
telegraphic in their brevity and usually show little emotion.
