		High I's need to &quot;charge their batteries&quot; by being around people. Because they spend so 
		much of their time interacting, they are usually verbally adept and fairly assertive in 
		using words to get their way. High I's are often effective motivators and are good at 
		getting agreement from employees, coworkers, and other associates. Their natural ease 
		and charm helps High I's to get the recognition and approval they need.

Their speech tends to be informal and filled with digressions. They pepper their 
conversation with stories and anecdotes and tend to insert themselves into most 
experiences. &quot;Well, you think that was bad! Let me tell you what happened to me!&quot; I's 
like to be center stage.
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
High I's speak with lots of inflection and variety. Their speech may even tend toward the 
dramatic, supported by animated facial expressions and expansive hand/body 
movements. Because they are contact oriented, High I's will often touch people lightly 
when talking to them.
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
They are vivacious both in person and on the telephone, using colorful, often humorous 
language that may tend toward exaggeration. They respond to the exciting and the 
glitzy, and they usually like visual stimulation. Keeping their attention can be a 
challenge.

Although I's would rather speak than write, their written communication also displays 
energy and enthusiasm, often punctuated by highlighting elements, such as bold-face 
type, along with lively, vibrant language.
