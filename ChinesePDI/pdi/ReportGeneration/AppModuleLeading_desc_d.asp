High D Leader: The Pathfinder

<%=AppModParaFont%>
High D leaders are decisive, competitive, and quick to take action. They assume 
responsibility readily, accepting and enjoying the role of leader, and find motivation for 
themselves and others through the challenge. Those who follow a D's leadership know 
that person to be hands-on, high-energy, and 
confident of the outcome.

High D's focus on the destination rather than the journey, lose patience with activities 
that lack clear, measurable goals, and thrive on crises. The riskier the venture and the 
more change involved, the more excited the High D leader will be about the task. As a 
result, they often create and operate in a "thrill-a-minute environment." High D leaders 
expect a lot from those who follow them, demanding a fair amount of independent 
decision-making and risk-taking from those who choose to travel with them.
