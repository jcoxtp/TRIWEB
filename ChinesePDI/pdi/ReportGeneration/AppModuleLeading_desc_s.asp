<%=AppModParaFont%>
High S leaders inspire others through collaboration and sincerity. They lead by example, 
preferring to demonstrate rather than command and making sure that those who follow 
them are aligned with the vision and part of any decision-making process. Approachable 
and down-to-earth, High S leaders make sure that everyone stays involved in solving 
problems, making decisions, and reviewing progress. They are patient, persistent, and 
predictable, and create environments where people aren't afraid to make mistakes. 
They also allow those they lead to draw their own conclusions. Personal relationships 
are an important dimension of both their temperament and their leadership style.

Since they tend to dislike abrupt change, they make sure that everyone participates in 
the change process, bringing the group along in a systematic, methodical way.
