		High C communication tends
		to be objective, fact-based, and task-oriented. Formal and polite, High C&#146;s
		rarely inject emotion, personal opinions, or gut feelings into their
		discussions. They tend to ask questions more than make statements, 
		but at other times they can
		overwhelm an audience with facts and details, assigning the same degree of
		importance to so much information that it is sometimes difficult to grasp the
		main points.

<%=AppModParaFont%>High C&#146;s speak with few
inflections, limited variations in pitch or volume, and minimal gestures. They
tend to adopt a steady delivery and speak rather slowly and at a lower volume
than other styles. Under stress, the volume of a High C speaker decreases even
more. Body language tends to be restrained, and they rarely touch someone
during conversations. 
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>In spoken communication,
High C&#146;s tend to talk in structured, careful speech patterns, weighing their
words and answering questions rather than volunteering information. Their
statements often contain qualifiers and disclaimers. Although they provide many
details in their communication, at times their telephone conversations can be
brief and to the point.

<%=AppModParaFont%>
A lot of small talk is not
on their radar screen. They simply see no need to let chitchat interfere with
the business at hand. They may appear uninterested in the personal lives of
others and are often very private about their own.
<%=EndAppModParaFont%>

<%=AppModParaFont%>
High C&#146;s need to be correct
themselves and are often quick to point out mistakes in others, not maliciously
but to set things right. Because they document carefully, their written
communication is formal, lengthy, and filled with data.
