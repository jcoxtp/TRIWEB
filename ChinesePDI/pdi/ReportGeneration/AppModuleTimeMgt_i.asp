		The High I tries to bring others into alliance in order to accomplish results. They

		High I's are generally spontaneous and loosely disciplined. They really don't want to 
		worry about managing themselves, because they see excessive self-discipline as 
		structure.
		<br><br>
		They are usually energetic, although they often dissipate energy pursuing too many 
		things at one time, often without focus.

<%=AppModParaFont%>
High I's tend to operate in the present. They don't like to pay too much attention to time, 
because time imposes structure. For this reason they are often late, but they are also 
tolerant of others' tardiness. To a High I, relationships are more important than 
timeliness.

		on time and then wait for them if necessary.</td>
