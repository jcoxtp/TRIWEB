<%=AppModParaFont%>
&#149;	Don't usurp the limelight or the initiative.<br>
&#149;	Maintain focus on plans, goals, and results.<br>
&#149;	Concentrate more on details, facts, risks, and probabilities than you normally do.<br>
&#149;	Focus on the basic, core aspects of your work. High I leaders may neglect those 
in favor of novel, new, or innovative aspects.<br>
&#149;	Be prepared to handle routine, repetitive projects or those of long duration; High I 
leaders will appreciate your doing them for him or her.<br>
&#149;	Focus on finishing projects that either you start or the leader starts.<br>
&#149;	Make sure that you document important matters: the High I leader probably 
won't.<br>
