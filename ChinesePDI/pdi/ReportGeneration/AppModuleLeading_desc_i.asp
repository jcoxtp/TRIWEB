High I leaders inspire others through their highly developed persuasive and motivational 
powers. For them, the motivation is the recognition that success in a venture will 
produce, and they inspire others with their optimism and enthusiasm. Verbally adept 
and assertive, High I's are skilled at eliciting high performance from their followers with 
their natural charm and the ease with which they interact with others.
