<%=AppModParaFont%>
&#149;	Loosen up. High I leaders want to know what you think and how you feel about 
things.<br>

&#149;	Don't impose your ideas. Be prepared to brainstorm.<br>
&#149;	Involve High I leaders in important, new, or highly visible projects.<br>
&#149;	Don't try to usurp the limelight or the initiative.<br>
&#149;	Be tolerant of the High I leader's casual use of time.<br>
&#149;	Show how your ideas will make the organization look good or provide attention 
and recognition.<br>
&#149;	Don't do all the talking. Provide opportunities for give and take.<br>
&#149;	Be willing to listen, and listen attentively.<br>
&#149;	Be willing to digress and chat more than you normally do.<br>
