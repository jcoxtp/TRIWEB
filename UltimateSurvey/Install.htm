		<P class="normal">Ultimate Survey is a powerful application that allows 
			non-technical users to create and take complex surveys. In addition, it 
			includes an extremely powerful reporting interface that allows for detailed 
			analysis of survey responses.</P>
		<P class="normal">All ASP source code is included so that it can be easily 
			modified. Any ASP developer will be able to easily understand the code and make 
			changes to it as needed. All coding was done in accordance with a robust set of 
			coding standards, so the code is clean, consistent, and well documented. The 
			reason for doing this is so that the purchaser can easily install, modify, 
			maintain, and augment the existing code base.</P>
		<P class="normal">To use this system, your web site must be running Microsoft IIS 
			with full support for Active Server Pages. The application has been written to 
			run against either a SQL Server or MS Access database.</P>
		<p>
			<A NAME="Installation">
				<SPAN CLASS="Heading">Installation</SPAN></A><BR>
		</p>
		<P class="normal">The steps to install Ultimate Survey are as follows:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				<p class="normal"><b> <a name="webserver">Web Server Setup</a></b><br>
					<br>
					<STRONG>a) Installing the ASP files. </STRONG>Unzip the files to a directory on 
					the web server. If necessary, create a virtual directory to point to the 
					application’s root directory. Note: this document assumes that it will be 
					installed in a directory called "UltimateSurvey" but you may change it.</p>
				<P class="normal">The directory structure for the application is:</P>
				<UL>
					<LI>
						<p class="normal">
							UltimateSurvey – Contains .asp files that display allow for creating, taking, 
							and reporting on surveys.
							<UL>
								<LI>
									<p class="normal">Include – Contains all include files (_inc.asp extension)
										<UL>
											<LI>
												<p class="normal">Stylesheet – Contains stylesheet (CSS) for application.</p>
											</LI>
										</UL>
								<LI>
									<p class="normal">Images – Contains all images<UL>
											<li>
												<p class="normal">&nbsp;Upload - Folder to hold all uploaded images</p>

										Database – Contains the SQL script needed to install the application on a 
										Microsoft SQL Server database and the MS Access databases</p>
								</LI>
							</UL>
					</LI>
				</UL>
				<P class="normal">
					<STRONG>b) Setting permissions.</STRONG> You will have to set "write" 
					permissions on the folder that will contain your uploaded images (Images/Upload 
					by default) , so that you can upload images for surveys as desired</P>
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<P></P>
			<LI>
				<p class="normal"><b> <a name="databasesetup">Database Setup</a></b><br>
					<br>
					At this point, you must decide whether to use SQL Server or MS Access.&nbsp; 
					Choose your database and follow the corresponding&nbsp;instructions 
					below:&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p class="message">SQL Server is highly recommended for maximum speed and 
					scalability.</p>
				<P>
					<A NAME="MSAccess">
						<SPAN CLASS="normalBold">
							<U>INTRUCTIONS FOR MS ACCESS</U></SPAN></A>
				<P class="normal">
					The database, which has been fully populated with a username and various needed 
					values, is located in the "Database" directory. This folder contains two copies 
					of the Access database. The version named UltimateSurvey.mdb is in Access 2000 
					format, and the version named UltimateSurvey-97.mdb is in Access 1997 format. 
					Our recommendation is to use the version of the database in Access 2000 format, 
					but both versions should work fine. There are no database passwords by default.</P>
				<P class="normal">
					After deciding which version of Access you will be using, you may delete the 
					other Access database if you like.&nbsp; At this point, you may want to move 
					the database to another desired location on the server.</P>
				<P class="normal"><b> NOTE: The anonymous IIS user must have WRITE permission to this 
						file.</b></P>
				<p><U><a name="SQLServer"></a><SPAN CLASS="normalBold"><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SQL SERVER</SPAN></U>
				</p>
				<P class="normal">a) At this point, you may want to optionally create a new 
					database for the application. If you decide not to create a new database and to 
					use an existing database instead, note that all table names have the prefix 
					"usd_" so that they can easily be distinguished from other tables in the 
					database.</P>
				<P class="normal">
					b) Load the tables into the database. The script for the tables is located in 
					the file, "UltimateSurveyTables.sql," which is located in the "Database" 
					directory. The best way to load the tables is to open Microsoft Query Analyzer, 
					open this file from Query Analyzer, and execute.</P>
				<P class="normal">c) Create a user in the database for the Ultimate Survey 
					application. Grant this user full access to all of the tables.</P>
				<P class="normal">d) Load the required data into the database. The script for the 
					data is located in the file, "UltimateSurveyData.sql," which is located in the 
					"Database" directory. The best way to load the meta-data is to open Microsoft 
					Query Analyzer, open this file from Query Analyzer, and execute.<br>
					&nbsp;</P>
			<LI>
				<P class="normal"><b> <a name="DatabaseConnection">Database Connection Setup</a></b><br>
					<br>
					The application uses a DSN-less connection. The connection string is located in 
					the file, "SurveyConnection_inc.asp" in the Include directory. This file 
					contains two versions of the constant DB_CONNECTION. One of the versions is for 
					connecting to a SQL Server database, and the other is for using a MS Access 
					database. Above each constant are detailed comments for how to configure the 
					connection string for your database. At this point, comment out the constant 
					that you will not be using, and set up the connection string, as shown.<br>
					<br>
					In the same file, "SurveyConnection_inc.asp," there is a constant called 
					DATABASE_TYPE. Depending on whether you are using SQL Server or MS Access, the 
					value for this constant must be updated to either "SQLServer" or "MSAccess", as 
					appropriate. These values are noted in the comment above the constant.<br>
					&nbsp;</P>
			<LI>
				<P class="normal"><b> <a name="gettingstarted">Getting Started with Surveys</a></b><br>
					<br>
					a) By default, the application has a single user.&nbsp; The username for this 
					default user is "Admin" and the password is also "Admin". This account has been 
					granted full user rights to the entire application.&nbsp; Go to the main page 
					of the application and click "Login" to begin using Ultimate Survey.<br>
					<br>
					b) It is highly recommended that you immediately edit user information by 
					clicking the username in the top right corner of the screen.<br>
					<br>
					c) Click "Settings" and carefully review each setting. Information on each 
					setting is found in the help section of the application. These settings may be 
					changed by any system administrator at any time.<br>
					<br>
					d) Add a survey. To start adding surveys, click the "Manage Surveys" tab and 
					then click "Add New&nbsp;Survey"<br>
					<br>
					e) All actions are explained throughout the application and the help section.</P>

		<P class="normal">This section contains information about various aspects of the 
			application. The purpose in giving this information is twofold: first, with 
			this information, users of the application will be able to better understand 
			the existing functionality. Second, this information will enable administrators 
			of the application and developers to more easily modify the code to their own 
			custom solution.</P>
		<P class="normal">Initially, the administrator is the only user who can create and 
			edit surveys. As users register, the&nbsp; administrator can go to "Manage 
			Users" and specify which users are allowed to create surveys, and can even 
			grant administrator privileges to users.</P>
		<P class="normal">All constants besides the connection string and database type 
			have been written in capital letters, with a prefix of SV (Survey) or 
			USD(Ultimate Software Designs), and are included in /Include/Constants_inc.asp. 
			For example, 'SV_DEFAULT_COMPLETION_MESSAGE'</P>
		<P class="normal">
			All functions that are in include files are prefixed with the name of the 
			include file.&nbsp; For example, if you see the function 
			"surveyCreation_createSurvey", you will know that it is located in 
			"Include/surveyCreation_inc.asp".</P>
		<P class="normal">For some surveys, and for all administration tasks, a user must 
			first log in. Once logged in, the user's username is stored in a cookie or 
			session, and security is done through validation of this cookie or session.</P>
