   of your own domain, you must add "http://" before the URL.

To redirect a user to a page where they see graph reports, set this value to "viewResultsNoHeader.asp?surveyID=x" where the x 
is replaced with the ID of the survey.  For this to work, the Privacy Level in survey properties cannot be set to "All Results Private".
