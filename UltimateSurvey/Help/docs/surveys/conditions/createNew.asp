Adds a new condition for the item or page.  You must choose a question, an operator, and either a value from the dropdown menu
or type in a value in the "Other" field.  (You do not need a value for 'Answered Question' or 'Did Not Answer Question') conditions.<br /><br />
If there is already at least one condition for the page or item, you will see a dropdown menu for groups.  Choose to add the condition to a new group
or an existing group.  Conditions grouped together have an "and" relationship, meaning that every condition in the group must be met for the item to show.
On the other hand, there is an "or" relationship between groups.<br /><br />
