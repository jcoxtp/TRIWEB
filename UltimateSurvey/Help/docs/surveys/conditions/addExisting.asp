Set the item or page to be conditionally displayed based on a condition you have already used for another item or page.
<br /><br />If there is already at least one condition for the page or item, you will see a dropdown menu for groups.  Choose to add the condition to a new group
or an existing group.  Conditions grouped together have an "and" relationship, meaning that every condition in the group must be met for the item to show.
On the other hand, there is an "or" relationship between groups.
