	Question libraries allow you to have a repository of questions and static items.  When creating a survey, you may 
	choose to add as many items as you please from these libraries.  When you do so, a copy of the item in the library is added
	to the survey.  Because it is a copy, you may edit the item in the survey without affecting the item in the library.  This
	also means that editing the item in the library will not affect correspond items that are already used in surveys.
