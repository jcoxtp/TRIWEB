<h1>Manage Users</h1>
<p class="body">You use Manage Users to set up and maintain accounts
for DimensionNet  users, and to set up and maintain user groups (known
as <span class="definedword">roles</span> in DimensionNet).</p>
<p class="body">When DimensionNet is installed, the following special
roles are created:</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;<span class="runinhead">DPMAdmins</span> This is an administration role and the user named as the DPM administrator
during installation is made a member of this group. Anyone who is
part of this group has unlimited access to all projects, activities,
and activity features.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;<span class="runinhead">CATIsupervisor</span> This role is for CATI supervisors and is set up to provide access
to the following activities:</p>
<p class="list-contin">&ndash; DimensionNet (excluding the "Allow
unlock project" feature)<br>&ndash; Manage Users<br>&ndash; Interviewer
Monitoring (including the "Can set up supervisor stations" feature)<br>&ndash; Dialer Administration<br>&ndash; View Survey Link<br>&ndash; Launch (excluding the "Allow upload/edit sample script"
and "Allow access via DimensionNet" features)<br>&ndash; Participants
(including all features except "Can create databases" and "Can delete
participants" <span class="superscript">1</span>)<br>&ndash;
Email<br>&ndash; Phone Surveys (including all features except "Can
edit fields", "Can edit call outcomes", and "Can delete call outcomes")<br>&ndash; Quotas (including only the "Allow editing quota targets,
completes, and prioritization" and "Allow editing quota targets" features)<br>&ndash; Phone Participants (including the "Can set up interviewer
stations" feature)<br>&ndash; Export Data<br>&ndash; Survey Results<br>&ndash; Status<br>&ndash; Phone (including only the "Can view
all interviewers' data" feature)</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;<span class="runinhead">CATIinterviewer</span> This role is for CATI Interviewers and is set up to give access
only to DimensionNet (excluding the "Allow unlock project" feature)
and the Phone Participants activity (excluding the "Can set up interviewer
stations" feature). <span class="italic">You must make your interviewers
members of this role if you want mrInterview to take interviewer qualifications
into account when assigning calls to interviewers</span>.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;<span class="runinhead">TabulationFullAccess</span> This role is for users who require access to all of the mrTables
and Reporter functionality. Access is provided to the following activities:</p>
<p class="list-contin">&ndash; DimensionNet (including the "Allow
unlock project" feature)<br>&ndash; Project Editor (including the
"Allow modifying properties", "Allow creating new projects", and "Allow
changing the project state" features)<br>&ndash; Files<br>&ndash;
Delete (including the "Allow delete project" feature)<br>&ndash;
Tabulation (including the "Full access" feature)<br>&ndash; Reporter</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;<span class="runinhead">TabulationMediumAccess </span> This role is for mrTables users and Reporter users who need to set
up their own projects and tables and edit variables on individual
tables, but who do not need to edit variables at project level. Access
is provided to the same activities as for the TabulationFullAccess
role, except that the Tabulation activity and Reporter activity includes
the "Medium access" feature instead of the "Full access" feature.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;<span class="runinhead">TabulationMinimumAccess</span> This role is for mrTables users and Reporter users who do not need
to set up their own projects or tables, or edit variables. Access
is provided to the following activities: <br>&ndash; DimensionNet
(excluding the "Allow unlock project" feature)<br>&ndash; Tabulation
(including the "Minimum access" feature)<br>&ndash; Reporter</p>
<h2>User Properties</h2>
<p class="body">User properties define any special abilities or qualifications
that a user has in relation to the requirements of one or more activities.
One of the most common uses of user properties is for interviewer
qualifications which help to determine which records are allocated
to each interviewer for calling. For example, if a participant record
indicates that the participant's usual language is French, the project's
Sample Management script can ensure that the record is allocated to
a French-speaking interviewer.</p>
<p class="body">User properties are defined as part of property groups,
each of which is associated with a specific role. Only members of
the role may have user properties assigned to them from groups associated
with that role. Currently, interviewer qualifications are the only
user properties that the standard Dimensions activities recognize.
To use them, you must create a property group called InterviewerQualifications
and associate it with the CATIinterviewer role. You can then assign
interviewer qualifications to all members of the CATIinterviewer role.
If your company has added its own activities, and these activities
recognize user qualifications, you may create other types of properties
for use with those activities.</p>
<p class="body">There are three stages to setting up user properties,
some of which you will do more than others:</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp; Create a property group (for example, InterviewerQualifications)</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp; Add properties to the property group (for example,
Language spoken, Refusal converter)</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp; Assign properties to users. (For existing users,
simply modify the user's account and click the User Properties button
to assign the properties; when creating new users, you will be prompted
to assign properties as part of the user-creation process.)</p>
<p class="body">You can also change the definitions of properties
within a group, delete properties from a group, and delete property
groups.</p>
<p class="body">Although it is browser based, Manage Users
works in a similar way to  Windows Explorer. It displays an expandable
tree-like structure on the left of the page  for viewing current user
and group details, and uses the right-hand side of the page for displaying
more detailed information and links for possible actions.</p>
<p class="body">When you have finished using Manage Users, click the
Home icon in the menu bar.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="italic">Note</span>: If you want
to use Manage Users, you must be authorized in DimensionNet to use
it and must be a member of the role named in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SPSS\MRUserManagement\UserMgtAdministratorRole
registry key (which is the DPMAdmins role by default). For further
details open the <span class="italic">Dimensions Development Library</span> documentation and search for the topic entitled "Who Can Run Manage
Users and Manage Access".</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="superscript">1</span> Deleting participants from telephone interviewing projects can cause
phone reports to show unexpected results. If a user or role is assigned
to telephone interviewing projects, do not assign that user or role
to the "Can Delete Participants" feature.</p>
