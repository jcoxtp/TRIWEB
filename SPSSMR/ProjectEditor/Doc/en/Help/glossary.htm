<h1>Glossary</h1>
<span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Context. </span><span class="glossary-definition">Defines the
environment in which a text is to be   used. You can keep several
variations of each text in the metadata for use in   different circumstances,
as defined by the context--for example, analysis,   interviewing,
and publishing.</span></span><span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Data source component (DSC). </span><span class="glossary-definition">A component used to expose   data to the Data Model. Case data is
exposed by a case data source component   (CDSC), and metadata is
exposed by a metadata source component (MDSC). </span></span><span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Dimensions Development Library (DDL). </span><span class="glossary-definition">A free, downloadable   resource that provides information for scriptwriters
developing automated   survey and market research processes, software
developers wanting to leverage SPSS   Dimensions products and technology,
and those who simply want to understand   more about the Dimensions
technology. The DDL can also be installed from every Dimensions product
installation CD.</span></span><span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Label type. </span><span class="glossary-definition">Enable
different types of labels to be created   for different types of information.
For example, the default label type of   Label is used for question
and category texts and variable descriptions, and   the Instruction
label type is used for interviewer instructions.</span></span><span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Mapped category value. </span><span class="glossary-definition">A numeric value that the Data Model   assigns to each unique category
name in the metadata. </span></span><span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Superversion. </span><span class="glossary-definition">A
combination of two or more versions of the   metadata. The versions
are combined to form a superset, although when there is   a conflict
between, for example, a text in one or more of the versions, the 
 more recent versions generally take precedence over the older versions.
  However, you can sometimes specify the order of precedence. You
typically use a   superversion when you want to export or analyze
response data that has been   collected using more than one version
of the questionnaire.</span></span><span class="glossary"><span class="glossary-term">Version. </span><span class="glossary-definition">Refers to changes
to the content of a project. As   the project changes (with new questions
or categories in a tracking study, for   example), each set of such
changes will generate a new version. Each generated   version is stored
in the metadata and you can choose the version or versions   you want
to use.</span></span>
