<h1>Deleting Projects</h1>
<div class="imageblock">
<img alt="" src="images/delete.gif"></div>
<p class="body"></p>
<p class="body">Deleting a project removes it from DimensionNet
and DimensionNet's  distributed property management system (DPM).
You can also delete the project's files and its case data, sample
management and quota databases.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="italic">Note</span>: The Firefox
browser does not support project deletion. Contact your Dimensions
administrator to find out how to do this.</p>
<p class="body">If the project uses sample management, the sample management
object is also deleted. If you have projects that share sample management
objects, you should ask your DimensionNet administrator to change
this behavior so that deleting a project does not delete the sample
management object. </p>
<p class="body">It is recommended that projects to be deleted are in
the Inactive state. If you try to delete a project that is not in
this state, the deletion procedure will ask whether you want to change
the project's state before deleting it.</p>
<p class="body">When you activate a project, the activation process
creates a project folder in the Projects subfolder of the mrInterview
installation folder, and places a copy of the project's <span class="name">.mdd</span> file in this folder. This folder exists
on every machine running the interviewing server and is updated automatically
by the activation process. For example, if you activate the tea project
every interviewing server will contain the file [INSTALL_FOLDER]\SPSS
Dimensions\mrInterview\Projects\tea\tea.mdd. These
folders and files are not deleted when you delete a project in DimensionNet,
but you may delete them manually afterwards.</p>
<p class="body">If your company uses a hierarchical project list, deleting
the last project from a folder automatically deletes the folder too.
If you delete the last project and the folder is not deleted, this
is because the folder contains other projects that are invisible to
you because you do not have permission to use them.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">To Delete a Project</span>
</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Select the project in the DimensionNet project list.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Click the Delete icon.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> If the project is not Inactive, DimensionNet displays
a reminder that this is  recommended and asks whether you want to
change the project's status now. Click <span class="screen">Yes</span> to change the status and then delete the project, <span class="screen">No</span> to leave the project's state as it is
and then delete the project, or <span class="screen">Cancel</span> to cancel the deletion request.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Next, you are asked whether you want to delete the
case data and other files associated with the project. The default
is to delete the project from DimensionNet and DPM but not to delete
any files. To delete the case data, sample management, and quota files,
select <span class="screen">Delete will remove existing files
and the case data database</span>. If you do not want to delete
sample management or quota files, cancel the checkboxes that this
option has selected for you. Click <span class="screen">Continue</span>. If you have any doubts about deleting the project, click <span class="screen">Cancel</span> as this is your last opportunity
to cancel the deletion request.</p>
<p class="body">DimensionNet processes your deletion request and displays
a message box when the  project has been deleted.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Click <span class="screen">Close</span> to
close the message box.</p>
