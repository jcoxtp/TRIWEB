<h1>Unlocking Other People's Projects</h1>
<p class="body">Some users (usually managers) have permission
to unlock other people's projects. If you unlock a project that is
locked by another user, any project files in the shared folder become
available to other users. Files that the user has in his/her user
folder remain there and do not become available to other users. If
these files have been changed more recently than the files in the
shared folder then there is the possibility that whoever works on
the project next will be using out of date  files.</p>
<p class="body">Here is a very simple example that clearly illustrates
why project locking is so important and why you should not unlock
other users' projects unless it is really necessary.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;Ben creates a new project and uses Build to build
the questionnaire. DimensionNet locks the project as soon as Ben uses
Build. Ben knows that it will take a few days to complete the questionnaire
so he decides to check his files in at the end of each day but to
leave the project locked until he has completed the questionnaire.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;Michael unlocks Ben's project and opens it in Build.
He makes some changes to the questionnaire, checks in the files, and
unlocks the project.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;Ben does not know that Michael worked on the project,
and continues building the questionnaire using the files in his User
folder. He checks his files in at the end of the second day. Ben's
files overwrite the files that Michael checked in and all Michael's
changes are lost.</p>
<p class="body">This situation could have been avoided if Michael
had told Ben that he wanted to work on the project. Ideally, he should
have asked Ben to unlock the project. If Ben was not available to
do this, Michael should either have left the project locked, or he
should have told Ben that he had worked on the project. In either
case, Ben would then have known to check out the latest files from
the shared folder before adding new questions to the  questionnaire.</p>
