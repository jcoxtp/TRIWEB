<h1>Uploading Files from your Computer into your User Folder</h1>
<p class="body">You can upload files from your computer into your user
 folder on the  DimensionNet server. This allows you to use files such as
templates  or image files that have been created outside of DimensionNet.
You can upload up to ten files at a time. Manage Files can upload files whose
full pathnames are no longer than 128 characters. If you have files whose
pathnames are longer than this you  will need to rename them
before uploading.</p>
<p class="body">The Files activity uploads files in two stages. First it makes
 a copy of each file in a temporary folder. Each file is given a  unique temporary
name so that there is no chance that two people uploading  files with the
same name will overwrite each other's files. Then, it copies each file in
turn into the project's folder in your user folder, renaming  the file as
it does so, and deletes the temporary file from the Temp folder.  (The name
of the temporary folder is defined in the registry in the DimensionNetUploadFolder
key and defaults to c:\InetPub\wwwroot\SPSSMR\Temp.)</p>
<p class="body">Files makes the following checks as it copies files into your
user  folder:</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">Filenames</span>.
 All files belonging to a project must have a name whose root matches the
project  name; that is, they must be called ProjectName.<span class="italic">xxx</span>.
 Activities locate the files they need to use by taking the project's name
 and looking for files whose root matches that name. When creating files,
activities  name them by using the project name with an appropriate extension.
The exceptions  are template files, which are often shared between many projects,
and sample  files.</p>
<p class="body">When you upload a file that has an extension that DimensionNet
 recognizes as a project file extension, and its name does not match the name
 of the current project, Files asks you whether you want it to rename the
file.  You should normally answer Yes to this question. </p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">Existing files</span>.
 If a file already exists in your user folder, Files asks whether to overwrite
it with the uploaded file. If you answer No, the file is not uploaded.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">.mdd files</span>.
The procedure for existing files applies, but Files does not upload the file
if its format is invalid or if it was created with a later version of Dimensions
that you are using now. (Technically, the test is whether the file's version
number is greater than the version number of the MDMLib component that is
installed on your computer.)</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">Empty files</span>.
 Files issues a warning and ignores the file.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">Zipped files</span>.
 Files unzips the contents of the zipped file so that the component files
are  available separately in your user folder (the exception is if the zipped
file  contains another zipped file; in this case the second zipped file is
not unzipped).  All checks for non-zipped files are carried out on the individual
files in  a zipped file so, for example, if the zipped file contains an <span class="name">.mdd</span> file  that already exists in your user folder
you will be asked whether to overwrite  the existing file or merge the uploaded
file into the existing file. </p>
<p class="body">If the zipped file contains a folder structure, Files creates
 new subfolders within the project folder to match this structure. This ensures
 that the relationships between the files in the zipped file are maintained
 when the files are uploaded.</p>
<p class="body">You can create subfolders within the project folder and upload
 files into subfolders. You might want to do this if you want to keep template
 files and stylesheets separate from the other project files, or if you have
 language-specific files that you want to store separately.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="italic">Notes:</span>
</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The Files activity does not support pathnames or filenames
 containing Japanese characters. If you want to upload a file whose name contains
 Japanese characters you should rename it first. </p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;If you are using Internet Explorer with a pop-up blocker
 installed and you are uploading files from different machines using the IP
 addresses of those machines, you must turn off the pop-up blocker if you
want  to upload zipped files.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">To Upload Files into your User Folder:</span>
</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> If necessary, navigate to the subfolder into which you want
 to upload files.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> From the Files menu, choose:</p>
<p class="menuselection">&nbsp;Actions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upload</p>
<p class="body">This opens the Upload Files dialog box. The Files to
 Upload list is empty when you start but will later display the names of the
 files you have chosen to upload.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Click <span class="screen">Browse</span>.</p>
<p class="body">This opens a standard Windows Choose file dialog box.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Select the file you want to upload and click <span class="screen">Open</span>.</p>
<p class="step-contin">The filename is added to the Files to Upload list. If
 you choose a file whose name already exists in the Files to Upload list (even
 if the file is from a different location) an error message is displayed and
 your selection is ignored.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> Repeat these steps to select more files. The Browse button
 is disabled once you have chosen ten files. </p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span>  If you need to remove a file from the upload list, click the
 red cancel icon next to the filename. If you decide not to upload any files
 at all click <span class="screen">Cancel</span>.</p>
<p class="step">
<span class="step-glyph">►</span> When you have finished choosing files, click <span class="screen">Upload</span>.</p>
<p class="step-contin">A progress dialog box shows the status of the upload
 process and the name of the file currently being uploaded.</p>
<p class="step-contin">You can cancel the upload at any time by clicking <span class="screen">Cancel</span>. This stops copying files and deletes any
 that have already been copied into the Temp folder.</p>
<p class="step-contin">When all files have been uploaded, you are returned
to the main screen where you will see the uploaded  files tagged as Private
in the file list.</p>
<p class="body">
<span class="runinhead">To Create a Subfolder to Upload into:</span>
