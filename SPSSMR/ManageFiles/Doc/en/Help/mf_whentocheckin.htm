<h1>When to Check Files In and Out</h1>
<p class="body">Some users find the concept of checking files in and out
 confusing, and often worry that they will lose their work either because
someone  else overwrites a file with a different version, or because they
start working  on the wrong version of a file without realizing it. The rules
for checking  files in and out can vary between and within companies, depending
on the number  of people involved in a project's development, so it is hard
to give fixed  rules about when to check files in and out. This topic gives
some recommendations  on good practise regarding checking files in and out,
and provides an example  that may help to clarify the situation further.</p>
<p class="body">If you are worried about losing work, remember that all the
 time you have a  project locked, very few of the project files will be available
 to any user who does not have administrative privileges. However, do not
fall  into the trap of keeping a project locked indefinitely as this can be
annoying  and counterproductive too.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="body">When you work on a project, you always work on files in your
 personal User folder. Activities such as Build, that create questionnaires,
 always look for files in your User folder first, and will open those files
 if they exist. If an activity cannot find the files it needs in your User
 folder, it looks for those files in the Shared folder. If the activity finds
 the files it wants in the Shared folder, it copies them into your User folder
 and opens them. If the files cannot be found in your User folder or in the
 Shared folder, the activity creates a new file in your User folder and opens
 that file.</p>
<p class="body">Certain options within activities create files in the Shared
 folder as well as in  your User folder. For example, if you activate a questionnaire
 from within Build, the project's  <span class="name">.mdd</span> is
 checked in to the Shared area as part of the activation process. However,
 as long as you have the project locked, no one else can access the files
in  the Shared folder, so you can continue working on the project, knowing
that  nobody else has access to  the files.</p>
<p class="body">You can check files in to and out of the Shared folder whenever
 you wish, simply by running Files. If you are the only person working on
a  project, it is not important when you check files in because you will always
 have the files you need in your User folder. This is not the case when you
  are working on a project with other people. In that situation, it is important
 that you check files in and out regularly and at the appropriate points in
 the project's development cycle, as this ensures that each user has access
 to the latest versions of the project's files.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p class="body">The following recommendations should ensure that everyone working
 on a project has access to the latest versions of the project files.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;When you start work on an existing project, always run Files
 and look to see  whether there are any project files in the Shared folder.
 If so, check these files out. This places copies of those files in your User
 folder.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;When you start work on a new project, check your files in
 regularly. For example, if you are designing a new questionnaire using Build,
 you might want to check your files in when you have finished the first draft
 of the questionnaire.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;If you have finished working on the project for the time
 being and have checked all your files in, unlock the project so that other
 users know  that they can use the files.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;It is possible to unlock a project without checking in files,
 but this is bad practise as this is how newer files can be overwritten with
 out of date ones. If you unlock a project that already has files in the Shared
 folder, and you are interrupted before you have time to check in your latest
 files, someone else may check out the old files from the Shared folder. If
 you then check in your files, they will be overwritten when the other person
 checks in their changes, and your changes will be lost. Get into the habit
 of checking in files and then unlocking the project. If in doubt, do not
unlock  the project.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;As soon as you run an activity on a project, the project
 is locked and other users will not be able to access the files. If you are
 ready to work on a project but cannot run an activity straight away, lock
 the project to prevent other users using the files.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p class="body">Here is an example that illustrates how an questionnaire
 designer, a translator, and a scriptwriter can all work on a project together.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The questionnaire designer creates the project and runs Build
 to build the basic questionnaire. It takes the designer two days to complete
 the first draft of the questionnaire. The project is automatically locked
 by questionnaire designer, so the translator and scriptwriter cannot access
 any of the files that Build creates. (In any case, until the questionnaire
 designer  checks the files in manually or tests or activates the questionnaire,
 the files exist only in the User  folder.)</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The questionnaire designer tests the questionnaire, which
 automatically copies files from the User folder into the Shared folder. However,
 because the project is still locked, no one else can access these files.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The questionnaire designer continues the cycle of testing
 and modifying the  questionnaire. Because no one else has yet worked on the
 project, and because Build always uses the files in the User folder if they
 exist, there is no need for the questionnaire designer to check in the files
 during this process.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;At the end of the second day, the questionnaire designer
 has finished all she can do on the questionnaire and is ready to pass it
to  the scriptwriter for the final changes to be made prior to translation.
She  therefore uses Files to check all the files in her User folder into the
Shared  folder, and then unlocks the project. At this stage, the files in
the Shared  folder become available to the scriptwriter and the translator.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;On the third day, the scriptwriter checks the project files
 out from the Shared folder into her User folder. Because she will not be
able  to work on the files straight away she locks the project to ensure that
no  one else can check out the Shared files and start working on them.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;Later that day, the scriptwriter makes some additions to
 the questionnaire and runs some final tests. She does not check the files
 in after every change because she has the project locked and knows that no
 one else can access the Shared files. When the scriptwriter is satisfied
that  the questionnaire is finished, she checks all the project files that
are in  her User folder into the Shared folder and unlocks the project. This
makes  the files in the Shared folder available to other users.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The translator checks out the <span class="name">.mdd</span> file
 and locks the project, even though she cannot use mrTranslate through DimensionNet.
 She then  downloads the file onto her computer and translates the texts.
When  she has finished, she uses Files to upload the translated file into
her User  folder and then checks it in to the Shared folder. Finally, she
unlocks the  project.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The scriptwriter checks all the project files out into her
 User folder and runs some final tests to ensure that the script appears correctly
 in the various translations. She works on the project as soon as she has
checked  out the files, so she lets DimensionNet lock the project for her
automatically.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The scriptwriter activates the project in Active mode, and
 the project becomes available for live interviewing. If the scriptwriter
made  any changes to the questionnaire, she checks the files back in before
unlocking  the project.</p>
<p class="body">Some users (usually managers) have permission to unlock
 other people's projects. If you have this permission, be very careful when
 you use it and what you do with the project files after you have unlocked
 the project. For information about unlocking other people's files, and an
 example that illustrates the possible pitfalls of careless unlocking,   refer to "Unlocking Other Peoples' Projects" in the DimensionNet
 User's Guide. </p>
